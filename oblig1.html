<h1>WEBPAGE A</h1>
<!--Pro-et-contra, group work-->
<h2>ARGUMENTS AGAINST GROUP WORK</h2>
<p>Risk of repeating the same information inside a project. </p>
<p>Delivering clear and obvious tasks to each other can be hard to do inside a group </p>
<p>People in the group may not exactly understand their task </p>
<p>Tasks can end up being repeated. Several people doing the same thing is often not efficient or effective.</p>

<h3>ARGUMENTS FOR GROUP WORK</h3>
<p>Increasing creativity of the project you are working on. The reason why working in a group increases the creativity, is because when you do something on your own, it is easy to find a solution and stick to it. When in a group, you will find different solutions, and together decide which one is best suited to solve the problem.</p>
<p>Working in a group allows for tasks to be divided among the group members, which can significantly improve the pace at which tasks are completed.</p>
