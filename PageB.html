<h1>WEBPAGE B</h1>
<!--Everyone's invidiual statement(s) about their former school-->
<h2>Student number 386108</h2>
<p>My VGs was very different from others because it was located inside a football stadium. Although it had nice classrooms, a canteen and a gym for the students to train in their lunchtime or after school.</p>
<h3>Student number 386117</h3>
<p>My former school is located in Kristiansand. Kristiansand is my hometown and I recently moved to Oslo. At my former school I had training each day and a lot of subjects containing training and lifestyle. I specialized in handball and started my day with a workout each morning. </p>
<h4>Student number ******</h4>
<p>My former school is INN University. It had breathtaking nature right outside the campus. Some of the lecture halls could use some light remodeling.</p>
